# ==========================================================
# Semgrep Ruleset for C Security
# Created by: Conviso
# Description: This ruleset is designed to detect common vulnerabilities
#              in C applications, including Buffer Overflow,
#              Use After Free, Integer Overflow, and Command Injection.
# ==========================================================

rules:
  - id: detect-buffer-overflow
    languages: [c]
    message: |
      Potential Buffer Overflow detected. Avoid using unsafe functions such as `strcpy` or `sprintf` without proper bounds checking.
    severity: ERROR
    patterns:
      - pattern: |
          strcpy($DST, $SRC);
      - pattern: |
          sprintf($BUF, $FMT, ...);
    fix: |
      Use safer alternatives like `strncpy` or `snprintf`, ensuring the buffer size is properly checked. Example:
      
      ```c
      strncpy($DST, $SRC, sizeof($DST) - 1);
      $DST[sizeof($DST) - 1] = '\0';
      ```

  - id: detect-use-after-free
    languages: [c]
    message: |
      Potential Use After Free detected. Using memory after it has been freed can cause undefined behavior and vulnerabilities.
    severity: ERROR
    patterns:
      - pattern: |
          free($PTR);
          $VAR = *$PTR;
    fix: |
      Ensure the pointer is set to NULL after freeing the memory to avoid accidental use. Example:
      
      ```c
      free($PTR);
      $PTR = NULL;
      ```

  - id: detect-integer-overflow
    languages: [c]
    message: |
      Possible Integer Overflow detected. Ensure proper checks are in place when performing arithmetic operations on integers.
    severity: ERROR
    patterns:
      - pattern: |
          $VAR = $X + $Y;
      - pattern: |
          $VAR = $X * $Y;
    fix: |
      Add checks to ensure that the result does not exceed the limits of the integer type. Example:
      
      ```c
      if ($X > INT_MAX - $Y) {
        // Handle overflow case
      }
      $VAR = $X + $Y;
      ```

  - id: detect-command-injection
    languages: [c]
    message: |
      Potential Command Injection detected. Avoid using functions like `system` or `popen` with untrusted input.
    severity: ERROR
    patterns:
      - pattern: |
          system($CMD);
      - pattern: |
          popen($CMD, $MODE);
    fix: |
      Use safer alternatives and sanitize inputs before executing commands. Example:
      
      ```c
      if (validate_input($CMD)) {
        system($CMD);
      }
      ```

  - id: detect-strncpy-misuse
    languages: [c]
    message: |
      Possible misuse of `strncpy` detected. Ensure the destination buffer is properly null-terminated.
    severity: WARNING
    patterns:
      - pattern: |
          strncpy($DST, $SRC, $SIZE);
    fix: |
      After using `strncpy`, explicitly add a null terminator to ensure the destination string is properly terminated. Example:
      
      ```c
      strncpy($DST, $SRC, $SIZE - 1);
      $DST[$SIZE - 1] = '\0';
      ```

  - id: detect-unsafe-pointer-arithmetic
    languages: [c]
    message: |
      Unsafe pointer arithmetic detected. Ensure that pointer manipulation is done within the bounds of the allocated memory.
    severity: WARNING
    patterns:
      - pattern: |
          $PTR = $PTR + $OFFSET;
    fix: |
      Ensure that the pointer arithmetic does not go beyond the allocated buffer size. Example:
      
      ```c
      if ($PTR + $OFFSET < $BUF_END) {
        $PTR = $PTR + $OFFSET;
      }
      ```

  - id: detect-memory-leak
    languages: [c]
    message: |
      Possible memory leak detected. Ensure that allocated memory is freed before the function returns or at the end of its lifecycle.
    severity: WARNING
    patterns:
      - pattern: |
          $PTR = malloc($SIZE);
          return $RESULT;
    fix: |
      Free allocated memory before returning or exiting the function. Example:
      
      ```c
      free($PTR);
      return $RESULT;
      ```
